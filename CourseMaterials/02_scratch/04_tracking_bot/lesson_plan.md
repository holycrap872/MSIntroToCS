## Essential Questions

- How can we use sensing to provide feedback to a system?
- How can we break down a goal into easy to accomplish sub-tasks?

## Lesson Plan:

### Setup

- Have tracking bot open and code hidden

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - What was easy about bmtron
    - What was hard?
    - What were new blocks?
        - `or`
- New game today! But first...
    - Talk about feedback
        - What is feedback?
        - When and why is feedback important?
- Very proud of this game
- I'm considering making an app and if anyone steals it I won't hesitate to talk to a lawyer
    - Show how game works
        - Explain rules
            - Starts when person presses spacebar.
            - Draws line when person holds mouse down.
            - Stops drawing when person lets go.
            - Bot can't go on orange.
            - Mouse can't draw on green.
- Game is called Tracking Bot and it's mechanics are very simple
    - Can anyone figure it out?
    - Have discuss for a while but shouldn't take long
        - Put up answer on board
        - Make sure to emphasize what it does if no black line under it (It just moves forward)
    - Have go to shared documents folder and move TrackingBotSkeleton to desktop
        - In pairs, have them program bot so it can follow line to end of course
- Once everyone is done call back together
- Have them come up with goals to complete
    - Get Pen Moving and working
    - Get Bot Moving
    - Get Collisions working
    - Get second level working
- Show blocks going to need
    - `wait until` block
- Go!
