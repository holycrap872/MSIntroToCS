## Essential Questions

- How can we use variables to produce more efficient programs?
- How can we use variables to create useful programs for a human user?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

Preprogrammed scratch program that plays all the notes

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Variables
        - Set, change, store
    - Why are variables useful?
    - Why set outside loop, change inside
- Have program waiting that plays all the notes
    - Ask them to try and figure out what it does with their elbow partner
    - Review what's going on behind scenes with note change
    - Discuss
        - Could have a 120 line program but that would be annoying
        - What's a good name for this variable
        - Create it and listen to it
        - At end of program "Now every dog in the neighborhood is barking"
        - See `EveryNote` example in accompanying scratch program
- Today going to use this ability to make a lot of different types of programs
    - These are classic intro course problems
- Storing strings
    - Create variable named after student (e.g., `eric`)
    - Ask them to think about something
    - Create program `say(join("Eric is thinking about ", eric))` and run it
- Introduce `ask and wait` block
    - special `ask` variable
    - What user says gets moved into `ask` variable
    - Add onto above program to ask person what they are thinking about
- Further examples (if necessary/if have attention)
    - Password program
        - See `Password` example in accompanying scratch program
    - Count number of times you've said something
    - Multiply by 2 program
        - Ask for number and say number multiplied by 2
    - Program that adds 2 numbers
        - Let break and ask what went wrong
        - Need holder variables
        - introduce concept that variables can only remember 1 thing
- Start `variables_2_worksheet.docx`
    - Give 3m to read through it then summarize as class
    - Go!
