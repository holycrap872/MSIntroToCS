# Middle School Introduction to CS

This repository attempts to capture a half semester class that introduces
middles schoolers to various facets of Computer Science. The students within
the course are in 7th and 8th grade with a range of previous exposure to
computing.

## Mission

This course provides students an introductory look into the world of computers
and exposes them to big ideas in computer science. It is intended to demystify
the computer and give students the confidence to look "inside" the various
abstractions that give computers their power.

## Navigation

To understand the course, there are three places to look:

- The [Course Syllabus](./CourseMaterials/course_documents/syllabus.md) document for 
  the general expectations of the course handed out at the beginning of the class.
- The [Course Overview](./CourseMaterials/course_documents/course_overview.md)
  document for and understanding of the units of covered in during the class.
- The [Course Documents](./CourseMaterial/) folder for the full set of lesson plans
  and activities.

## Contributions

Overall, this course is a work in progress and I am open to any/all suggestions.
