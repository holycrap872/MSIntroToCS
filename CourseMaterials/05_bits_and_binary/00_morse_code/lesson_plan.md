## Essential Questions

- How do computers store information?
- How can computers share information over distance?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

The morse code "flashers" that are in the CS office

### Lesson Plan

- Reflection
    - Fractals
        - Fern: https://youtu.be/Zh4oVYty61M?si=34V-WuqAFQC64uN2
        - Tree generator: https://codepen.io/hippiefuturist/full/NRWOxM
        - Scenery generator: http://qiao.github.io/fractal-terrain-generator/demo/
- Who knows how computers store information?
    - Only thing computers understand: 1's and 0's
- Computers don't just store 1's and 0's, we have an internet
    - How could we send 1's and 0's (information) over long distances
        - Set up movie clip by explaining what's going on: sub-sub communication

            - How are the American's sending message?
            - What message are the Russians sending with one bit?
- How could we come up with a system to send words?
    - A's to 1 flash, B's to 2 flashes ...
    - They all knew morse code already
- What is a 1 in morse code and what is a 0?
- Hand out morse code cheat sheet
- Send various messages
    - Send SOS via lights
    - Have them do example problems in slide show
    - Have students encode their own message and send it to a student across the room
    - Then switch and send it the other way
- Discussion
    - Why not dits, dahs, dems, and doops?
        - Too difficult to tell apart
    - How did morse code change the world?
    - How is morse code like the internet?
    - How is it different?
    - Compression
        - Show picture of "morse code tree"
