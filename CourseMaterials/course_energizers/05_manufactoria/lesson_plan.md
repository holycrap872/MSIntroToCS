## Lesson Plan

This introduces (at a very high level) FSMs to 7th/8th graders under the
guise of programming and abstraction. This is done by playing manufactoria
and then comparing the game to representations of levels as FSMs.

In general, middle schoolers have enough patience to play for ~50 minutes
with hints before they start to get frustrated/bored.

### Setup

- Manufactoria on each computer
- Free profile on the game

### Actual Lesson

- Explain how to play manufactoria
    - Go to Applications/mft3.app
    - If see someone's played before select a new profile
        - Quiz them on this
    - Show how to play first two levels
        - wasd for conveyors
        - How stampers work
            - Show stampers adding to tape at the bottom
    - Go!
        - Give hints about where to put tubes in "Flautistry"
        - Give hints about where to play start/end in "Amaze Bots"
- Wait until someone to reach the "Factory Resets" level
    - Show how divider works
    - Show how tape works at the bottom
    - For a divider, how would you program it in scratch
        - If touching blue, face left...
- Go!
    - Have go up to Create expectations
        - If can solve Crate Expectations -> candy
- Reflection
    - Show FSMs
    - How is this a more abstract version of Manufactoria
