- What are variables?
- How can we use variables to produce more efficient programs?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

None

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Robozzle
    - Do http://www.robozzle.com/beta/index.html?puzzle=16169 together
        - What are functions?
        - What would be good names for the functions?
- Going to start back up with scratch
- What are variables?
    - Things that can change
- Human example
    - Matt remember 3, Nick remember 5, Matt + Nick
    - Variables can basically do three things
        - set, change, read
        - Demonstrate all of them using people
- Why are variables useful?
    - Allow more general programs
    - Don't have to write program that multiplies every possible number together
    - Instead, just one where plug in variables
- Show variables in Scratch
    - Make own
        - Name them nick and matt or whatever they were named before
        - Replicate actions did in human example
    - See `AddVariables` function in accompanying scratch program
- Create a tempo increaser to play snare drum
    - Set outside loop
        - Set ~10
    - Change inside loop
        - Change ~5
    - Ask them what they think will happen
- Review variables
    - Set
    - Change
    - Store
- Hand out `variables_1_worksheet.docx`
    - Give 3m to read through it then summarize as class
    - Go!
