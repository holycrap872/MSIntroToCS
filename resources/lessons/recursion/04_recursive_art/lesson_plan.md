## Essential Questions

- What is recursion?
- How can recursion be used to simplify complex problems

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

Large paper
Regular paper
Colored pencils
Rulers

OR

Tape
White board marker
Stick their drawings onto a white-board tree

### Lesson Plan

- Reflection
    - Functions
    - Functions in scratch
    - Demo
        - Simplify code in `tic_tac_toe.docx` together
        - Recreate polygon function and then use it
- Today going to talk about fractals and recursion
    - Before we get started, do a quick drawing exercies
- Show a picture of a tree
    - Have them draw a "speed tree"
        - Give ~2m
        - Giving them too long will ruin the before/after effect
- Going to watch a bit of a movie and then discuss
    - Mandelbrot movie: https://youtu.be/d0Exnv8Ym7s?si=7nmgnrCIPdN9ThH5
        - Ads from 2:00 - 2:35
        - Watch up to 24:46 (fractal teeshirts)
- What did we learn there?
    - What are fractals?
    - How are trees like fractals?
    - Why are fractals so common in nature (and in humans)?
- Show various fractal demos
    - Fern: https://youtu.be/Zh4oVYty61M?si=34V-WuqAFQC64uN2
- Have them redraw a tree
    - Show before and after
    - Combine all the trees into one big class tree
        - Each of their trees is a branch on the big tree
