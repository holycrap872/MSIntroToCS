Lesson plan:

What are variables?
	Things that Can change
Maybe have them do excel example
	I haven't done this more than once or twice
	Good for classes that need slower pace
Human example
	Matt remember 3, Nick remember 5, matt + nick
	Variables can basically do three things
		set, change, read
		Demonstrate all of them using people
Why are variables useful?
	Allow more general programs
	Don't have to write program that multiplies every possible number together
	Instead, just 1 where plug in variables
Show variables in scratch
	Scratch already comes built in with a lot of variables
	Can you find them? (What are the things you can change)
		Click through each tab and have them find them
	make own
		Name them nick and matt or whatever they were named before
		Replicate actions did in human example
	See `AddVariables` example in accompanying scratch program
Show movement example where changes along x
	set outside loop
	change inside loop
	have a starting point and then advance from there
	General pattern just like games we've been making
	See `XCoordinateChange` example in accompanying scratch program
Create a fader
	set outside loop
	change inside loop
	Ask them what they think will happen
	See `MeowFade` example in the accompanying scratch program
Ask someone to walk through how to create a song that plays faster and faster
	Change Temp
Have make own band
	Need 3 "Band Members": Sprites
	Need at least six sets and six changes
	Warning: I've never heard a good one, given the time constraints
	Have everyone play their song before end of class

Homework:
None
