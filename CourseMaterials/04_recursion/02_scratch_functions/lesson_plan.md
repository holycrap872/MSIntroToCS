### Setup

### Actual Lesson

- Reminder to turn in homework
- Review
    - Variables
    - Why useful
    - Create review program that goes through every instrument in scratch
    - Create a loop in a loop to play a bunch of notes from each instrument
- What is a function?
    - Input/output

- Why functions?
    - Abstraction
- Do an example together:
    - Length of time to cook turkey function
        - Input: pounds, stuffed or not
            - 15m per pound stuffed
            - 13m per pound stuffed
        - Output: cook time
    - Hexagon together as a class
- Explain/talk through worksheet
    - Work in pairs
- Go!
