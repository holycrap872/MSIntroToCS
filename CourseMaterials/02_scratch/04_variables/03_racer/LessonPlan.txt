Part 4

Review:
	Variables
		What are ones that come with Scratch?
		Set vs. Change
		Why variables good?
	Opening Problem
		Create calculator
		Asks user for 2 numbers and operation (+-*/)
		Then says the solution of that operation performed on those 2 numbers
		Once everyone done, pick someone and go over answer on board
	Go over homework
	Motion
		Up to this point constant motion
		If your car was like this, it would be tough to get to school
			Would probably get thrown through windshield when stopping outside since going 30 right before that
		Realistic motion slow down speed up
	Activity
		Need 3 volunteers
			Warn this demonstration is terrible unless people are into it
			Pick excited people
			They're racers
		Need 3 more
			They're "pit crew" (start at 3, change by 0) (start at 0, change by 1) (start at -4, change by 2)
		Explain how it works
			Every time I say next time through the game loop...
				Racer turns around and asks pit crew how many steps to take
				Pit crew tells them
				Pit crew changes by their change number
				In that order
				Steps can be as big or small as you want
			Will keep going through the game loop until someone wins
		Do example
			Pick a pit crew person and ask what value they will tell their racer when asked first, then second...
		Do it
			Take down to gym
			Start on baseline
			First one to go out, touch opposite baseline, then come back wins
			Teacher acts as "loop" letting everyone go once before going on to next loop
			Do it twice
	Discuss
		What is a better name for the pit crew
			Variables
		What type of motion is this?
			Acceleration
	Do it in scratch
		Use "pick random sprite" in scratch; normally funny
		Name variables instead of speed people who were variables
			From experience, if the person increased by 2, make it .2 in scratch
		"Racer starts at starting line"-> go to statement before entering loop
			Build narrative
		What would be a better name for this variable?
		Show each person individually as build them, then simulate entire race
		Do example where someone starts at like 10 and slows down
		Do pseudo code of car on straight line on baord (Max speed)
	Racecar Game
		Pair up
		Pseudo code together
			1. Draw race track and car
			2. Get car moving
			3. Get car accelerating
			4. Get car decelerating
			5. Have car slow down when hits grass
		Once done psuedo coding, hand out sheet
			Follow directions exactly on sheet and will run into answer
	Analyze
		Speed v. time graph
			constant and accelerating
		Distance v. time graph
			constant and accelerating
