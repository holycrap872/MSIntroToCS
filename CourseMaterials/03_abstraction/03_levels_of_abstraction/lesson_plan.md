## Essential Questions

- How does abstraction help us as we go about our daily lives?
- What situations are necessary to "break through" abstraction levels?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Paper and pencils

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection:
    - What does abstraction look like in art?
    - What is abstraction?
        - Hiding unnecessary details
- Discussion about the similarities between abstraction in art and CS
    - In both, we:
        - Simplify complex ideas or systems.
        - Focus on the essential components.
        - Hide intricate details.
- Have student describe process to go to bathroom
    - Write each sentence up on board
        1. walk to bathroom
        2. go into stall
        3. XXXX
        4. flush
        5. go back to class
    - Who knows how flushing works?
        - Show video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqcYXeJ02U8
    - Break out `flush` step into its own 
        - Sideways tree structure
- Group Activity:
    - Have students write a step-by-step program (pseudocode) for their day
        - Break out to three levels
    - Have one group work on the board
    - Possible topics:
        - Making a car
        - Building a house
        - Baking a cake
        - Painting a landscape
        - Build a computer
        - Record a song
        - Get ready for school
- Go!
- Discussion:
    - Put up two figures, one with a tree like structure and one with just a list of 0-100
        - Which one is more abstract and why?
    - How is this like abstract art?
    - How many levels deep could you go?
    - How is this like scratch?
