### Lesson Plan

- Reflection
    - 
- Show a picture of a tree
    - Have them draw their best verison of it
        - Give ~5m
- Today going to be talking about recursion
    - What is recursion?
        - A function calling itself
- Going to watch a bit of a movie and then discuss
    - Mandelbrot movie: https://youtu.be/d0Exnv8Ym7s?si=7nmgnrCIPdN9ThH5
- What did we learn there?
    - What are fractals?
    - How are mountains fractals?
        - Show them my pygame program
    - How are trees like fractals?
    - Why are fractals so common in nature (and in humans)?
- Show various fractal demos

- Have them redraw a tree
    - Show before and after
    - Combine all the trees into one big class tree
        - Each of their trees is a branch on the big tree
