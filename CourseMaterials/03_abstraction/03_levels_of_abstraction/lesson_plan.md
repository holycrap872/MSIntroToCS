## Essential Questions

- How does abstraction help us as we go about our daily lives?
- What situations are necessary to "break through" abstraction levels?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Paper and pencils

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection:
    - What does abstraction look like in art?
    - What is abstraction?
        - Hiding unnecessary details
- Discussion about the similarities between abstraction in art and CS
    - In both, we:
        - Simplify complex ideas or systems
        - Focus on the essential components
        - Hide intricate details
- Functions and abstraction
    - How was the race car game an example of abstraction?
        - I designed the functions you used them
    - How was robozzle like abstraction
        - You both designed and used the functions
- This type of abstraction is everywhere
    - For example, how would you tell someone to bake a cake?
        - Ask students
        - Have them create program of 5-6 steps
        - Becoming less abstract is like an annoying sibling going "well how do you do that?"
- Have student describe process to go to bathroom
    - Write each sentence up on board (NOT ON SLIDES SO DON'T HAVE TO ERASE)
        1. walk to bathroom
        2. go into stall
        3. XXXX
        4. flush
        5. go back to class
    - Break out "walk to bathroom into sub program"
        - Stand up
        - Left foot/right foot
        - ...
    - Who knows how flushing works?
        - Show video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqcYXeJ02U8
    - Break out `flush` step into its own 
        - Sideways tree structure
- This way of viewing things can be use everywhere
    - High level detail with more detail waiting underneath when required
- Group Activity:
    - Have students write a step-by-step program (pseudocode) for their day
        - Break out to three levels
    - Have one group work on the board
    - Possible topics:
        - Making a car
        - Building a house
- Go!
- Discussion:
    - Put up two figures, one with a tree like structure and one with just a list of 0-100
        - Which one is more abstract and why?
    - How is this like abstract art?
    - How many levels deep could you go?
    - How is this like scratch?

#### Possible extension

- For next class: How is this like being a good leader?
    - Call back to sorting game
