## Essential Questions
- How can we use sensing to provide feedback to a system?
- How can we break down a goal into easy to accomplish sub-tasks?

## Lesson Plan:

### Setup

- Have tracking bot open and code hidden

### Actual Lesson
- Reflection
    - Cartesian plane
        - Do drawing game together as an example
        - How gameloop played into drawing game
    - What's been easy?
    - What's been hard?
- New game today! But first...
    - Take outside to front of the building
        - Who thinks they can touch the light post if they have their eyes closed?
            - Pick kid most likely to run blindly at the post
            - Give a few seconds of stumbling around
        - Alright that was entertaining, but anyone think they have a more reliable method?
            -Should end up walking with 1 foot on grass, 1 foot on pavement
- Bring inside
    - Very proud of this game
    - I'm considering making an app out of it and if anyone beats me to it I won't hesitate to talk to a lawyer
        - Show how game works
            - Explain rules
                - Starts when person presses spacebar.
                - Draws line when person holds mouse down.
                - Stops drawing when person lets go.
                - Bot can't go on orange.
                - Mouse can't draw on green.
    - Game is called Tracking Bot and it's mechanics are very simple
        - Can anyone figure it out?
        - Have discuss for a while but shouldn't take long
            - Put up answer on board
            - Make sure to emphasize what it does if no black line under it (It just moves forward)
        - Have go to shared documents folder and move TrackingBotSkeleton to desktop
            - In pairs, have them program bot so it can follow line to end of course
    - Once everyone is done call back together
    - Have them come up with goals to complete
        1. Get Bot Moving
        2. Get Pen Moving and working
        3. Get Collisions working
        4. Get second level working
    - Show blocks going to need
        - "wait until" block
    - Go!
        - Do in pairs

## Homework

- None
