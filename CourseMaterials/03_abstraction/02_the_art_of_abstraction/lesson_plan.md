## Essential Questions

- Why is abstraction important?
- How do we determine if something is necessary for a particular task?

## Lesson Plan

- Reflect
    - What did we talk about last class?
    - What is the difference between magic and technology?
    - Share quote:
        - "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
    - How do we hide the way something works and make it seem like magic?
    - When is this good and when is this bad?
    - What is abstraction?
- Discussion: Begin with a brief discussion about art.
    - Ask the students if they know what abstract art is.
    - Why did art get weird in the late 1800s?
        - Previously about capturing all possible details (as lifelike as possible)
        - Once camera invented, needed to go in a new direction
        - One direction was abstract art
        - Painters tried to capture the essence of an idea
        - Let everything else fall away
- Image Showcase: Show progression of images that go from realistic to very abstract

    - Discuss what we're seeing at each level
    - How does this relate to abstraction?
- Group Activity:
    - Have students select an object (or idea!!!) and look it up online
    - Each will draw (in semi-secret) the object three times:
        - First, as detailed and realistically as they can.
        - Second, in a simplified form with fewer details.
        - Third, in a very abstract form.
- Once everyone is done, show each progression (from most to least abstract)
    - Have students try and guess what it is
    - If guessed quickly, what could be removed? If couldn't guess, what should be added?
- Discussion:
    - What was easy and what was hard about identifying the images?
    - How did you know that determine that something was necessary while drawing?
    - What were some cool things we saw?
    - Do you like abstract art?
    - Abstract thinking is part of development. What does this mean?
- Clean up
    - Have students sign their favorite
    - Put away pencils

## Thoughts

- We could make this a pictionary type game where you can do a single line
  or circle at a time. Keep going until someone guesses.
