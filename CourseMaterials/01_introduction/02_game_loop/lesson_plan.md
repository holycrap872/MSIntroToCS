## Essential Questions:

- What is a game loop?
- How are common interactions we have with computer explained by game loops?
- How do games provide a good framework for understanding programming?

## Lesson Plan:

The goal of this lesson is to start to formalize the intuition from the previous
lessons about how programming is a series simple instructions. We want to
transistion from the fun/chaos of the lasers and see how many programs follow
the same basic logic and how they can be manipulated to do many cool things.

### Setup

- None

### Actual Lesson

- Reflection
    - Q: What did we do last class?
    - Q: What is a "computer"?
        - A: Anything that takes in instructions and acts on it
        - A: Fun fact, original computers were people in rows doing calculus problems
    - Q: Why do computers have restricted languages?
    - Q: What's a loop?
- Warning: Today is going to be fun, but I need your attention when I ask for it
- Run through slide show
    - Why Video Games Slide
        - Fun
        - Creative
        - Allows you to map natural behaviors to ones you seen on the screen through coding
    - Frame Rate
        - Make movie analogy
            - String enough small movements together, looks fluid
            - Video game is deciding what those small movements should be
        - Sprite sheets are the way they used to do it
            - 3D games are now more complex
    - The Game Loop
        - Just hammer it in, keep saying it over and over
    - Initialization
        - Why is initialization important?
        - What are some common things to do during initialization?
    - User Input Slide(s)
        - Open up fishy
        - Play fishy
            - What does the computer do to init?
            - What does the computer do to get input?
                - Computer running very fast so seems to respond to user
                - Really just constantly checking if touching key
                - If touching key then does something
            - How does the computer react to input?
    - Move Characters Slide(s)
        - After computer accepts user input, then need to move other characters
        - Can also universally apply set of rules such as gravity
            - Can be very simple to very complicated
        - Play moon landing simulator
    - AI Slide
        - Very complicated so not going to do a whole lot of AI
        - Watch videos and compare between 2012 and 2023
        - AI is similar to user input... program that makes its own decisions
            Self driving cars
    - Resolve Collisions Slide(s)
        - Explain both types of collision detection
            - Tradeoffs: One accurate and slow, the other quick and glitchy
        - Have play parking lot game
    - Drawing Slide
        - Don't have to worry about this with Scratch
            - Allows you to do quicker, better graphics
- Reflection:
    - Q: Why is speed important for these loops?
    - Q: Could a human "be a computer" and do a video game with paper?
    - Q: How is your daily life like a game loop?
- Homework
    - Log into scratch and email me a screen shot
