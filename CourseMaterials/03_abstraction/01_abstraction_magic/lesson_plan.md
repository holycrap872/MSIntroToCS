## Essential Questions

- How do multiple layers of abstraction affect understandability?
- What does too much abstraction do to a user?

## Lesson Plan

In this lesson, we discuss the difference between magic and technology. The
goal is to see that magic is an as of yet not understood force. This, in turn,
will lead to a discussion about how abstraction can make our interactions with
certain technologies "magic" like since we don't understand them. Treating
things as magic has an important effect: it allows us to become passive. This
passivity is good because it makes things easier to understand. The passivity
is bad, however, because we are at the mercy of the people who control the
"magic", whose purposes have historically not always been the best.

Summed up, the phrase "as if by magic" can be used to both save us time and
to hide important details from us.

### Setup

- Large poster board sized paper
- Markers

### Actual Lesson

- Share quote:
    - "Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."
- What does this mean?
- Questions:
    - What are things you interact with today that might be considered magic centuries ago?
    - What are magical things in books that we're already better at?
    - Why would some modern (useful) gadgets be considered magic while others are not?
    - What is abstraction?
- Break up into small groups and give them a big piece of paper and a marker
    - Two dimensions: magic then, magic now
        - Have them come up with objects and graph where they should be
        - Possible objects:
            - Fire
            - Bicycles
            - Television
            - Steam Engine
            - Eyeglasses
            - Compass
            - Radio
            - Telegraph
            - Microwave
            - Solar Panels
            - IC car
            - Electic car
            - Cameras
            - Painting
            - Robot
            - Chat CPT
            - Textile production
            - Fermentation
    - Break for 15m for discussion
- Come back and discuss
    - Note whenever people have the same object in different spots
    - Come up with definition for Magic
- Pivot to abstraction
    - Who knows what abstraction is?
    - Why is abstraction useful?
        - "As if by magic, something works"
    - When can abstraction be dangerous?
