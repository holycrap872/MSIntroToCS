BMTron

## Essential Questions

- How is a computer game like a puzzle?
- What different movement systems can the game loop reproduce?
- What are ways we can reduce the amount of repeated code?

## Lesson Plan

In this lesson, we increase the "fun" from the previous maze game and start
to investigate different types of motion. Really, however, this is just about
taking the principles of the previous lesson and applying them again. The overall
goal is to have them create the program with minimal hints and then appreciate
how engaging it can be.

### Setup

Have `drawing_game_skeleton.sb3` loaded up with the code hidden
Have `bmtron.sb3` loaded up with the code hidden
Have YouTube clip from tron up and loaded

### Actual Lesson

#### Day 1

- Reflection:
    - What did we do last class?
        - What is the game loop?
        - What are the parts of the game loop?
        - What is the difference between the drawing and the games?
            - infinite loop
            - No user input
- Let's see if you can figure out how one of my simple "games" works
    - Show `drawing_game_skeleton.sb3` and see if can figure out each part of gameloop
        - if/else for pen down
        - Change color constantly
    - Quickly turn it into four sprite drawing game by altering x, y multipliers
- Today going to do another video game
    - https://youtu.be/hMT8tRrEMC4?t=84s
    - Show my version of tron game and play with two people as an example
- Talk about similarities/differences between previous game
    - Always moving!
- Show new blocks
    - OR block
    - touching wall block
- This is a puzzle to see if you can figure it out on your own
- Start!
- Reflection:
    - What is a game that this reminds you of?
    - What was easy?
    - What was hard?
    - What did you remember from last time?
    - What did you forget from last time?

##### Homework

- None

#### Day 2

- Reflection
    - Game loop
    - Conditionals
    - BMTron
- Going to get back to game, but first: real life conditionals
    - Conditionals don't just have to be in computer programs
    - Can think of your life as a program
    - Some examples:
        - If hungry, then eat
        - repeat until not thirst: drink
    - What are a few you can thing of
        - if, if/else, repeat
    - Hand out worksheet
        - either `conditionals_worksheet_long.docx` or `conditionals_worksheet_short.docx`
        - Work next to elbow parter for ~10m
    - Reconvene and discuss
- Review BMTron
    - Get started again
- When finished, have rotate so can play other people's games
    - Allow to play 2 or 3 other games
- Reflection
    - What was good about other people's games
    - What could be improved
    - Important to accept feedback and improve
        - Helps find bugs
        - Helps improve products
