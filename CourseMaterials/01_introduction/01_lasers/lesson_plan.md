Programming Introduction

## EQ's

- What is programming?
- Computers are stupid?
- Why are conditionals needed?

## Lesson Plan:

The lesson follows the basic pattern of explanation, activity, debrief. The one
thing to note is that there are two "difficulties": one where students can use
any words they'd like to write the program and one where they're restricted to
a limited vocabulary. This is to drive a discussion about the difficulties of
programming vs. the difficulties of understanding/executing the program.

### Setup

- Lot of pieces of paper
- Ruler
- Pods

### Actual Lesson

- Introduce seating chart
- Reflection
    - Demystification
    - Point of this class
- What is a program?
    - Define computer
        - Follows instructions
    - Define program
        - Recipe
        - Scratch
    - Define programming language
- Introduction:
    - Today we're going to make and solve mazes in a variety of ways
        - Mazes were some of the first demonstrations of the capability of computers

            - 0:00 - 1:40
    - Rules
        - Break up into groups of 2
        - Make a maze
        - Switch
        - Write a program to solve the maze
        - Switch
        - One person closes their eyes and sees if they can get through to the
          end based on the program
        - Maze Rules
            - Closest of one inch between two lines
    - Example of what going to do on the board
    - Split in pairs
        - Have one group work on the board
        - Go
- Debrief
    - What was easy and what was hard?
    - Q: What was the hardest part
    - Q: What was unexpectedly easy?
    - Q: How is this similar to programming computers?
    - Q: How is this different from programming computers?
    - Q: Why are we using a restricted set of words?
- Show maze generation algorithms

    - How is this like the program's you wrote. How are they different?

#### Switch to Scratch

- What do we remember about Scratch?
    - Loops
    - If / Else
- Log on
- Create a Maze
- Only using the `move 1`, repeat X, and turn blocks solve the maze
