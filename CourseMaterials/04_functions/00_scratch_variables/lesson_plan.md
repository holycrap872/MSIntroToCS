## Essential Questions

- What are variables?
- How can we use variables to produce more efficient programs?

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- `variables_1_worksheet.docx` printed out and ready to go

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Abstraction
        - All the ways we learned about abstraction?
        - Why are functions an example of abstraction?
        - What abstraction is at its core
- Going to start back up with scratch
    - Scratch review
        - Game loop
        - if, if/else
        - init
- What are variables?
    - Things that can change
    - Lots of math stuff in CS
- Human example
    - Variables can basically do three things
        - set, change, read
    - Demonstrate all of them using people
        - Call up Matt and Nick
        - Matt remember 3, Nick remember 5, Matt + Nick
- Why are variables useful?
    - Allow more general programs
    - Don't have to write program that multiplies every possible number together
    - Instead, just one where plug in variables
- Show variables in Scratch
    - Make own
        - Name them "Nick" and "Matt" or whatever they were named before
        - Replicate actions did in human example
        - See `AddVariables` function in accompanying scratch program
    - Stress that it's important to come up with a good variable name
- Create a tempo increaser to play snare drum
    - Set outside loop
        - Set ~10
    - Change inside loop
        - Change ~5
    - Ask them what they think will happen
        - See `TempoChange` function in accompanying scratch program
- Review variables
    - Set
    - Change
    - Store
- Hand out `variables_1_worksheet.docx`
    - Give 3m to read through it then summarize as class
    - Go!
