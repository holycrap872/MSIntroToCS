## Essential Questions:
- Understand how computers store and represent certain types of information

## Learning Objective:
- Understand how bits can represent color
- Be able to encode and decode simple bitmaps

## Lesson Plan

- Reflection
    - Shell
    - 
- Today going to talk about pictures
    - What do people know about how pictures are stored on a computer?
- Only thing computers understand: 1's and 0's
- Each picture broken down into things called pixels
    - Show in preview
    - Zoom in
    - Just a bunch of small rectangles stuck together
- Start easy
    - How represent black and white?
        - 0 represent black (turn lights off)
        - 1 represent white (turn lights on)
- Teacup Picture
    - Ask them if they can see what it is
    - First row would be encoded 1,1,1, ...
    - How would next row be encoded?
        - Next row is 1, 0, 0, ...
    - Missing row is encoded 1, seven 0's, 1, 1, 0, 1
- House Picture
    - Have student come up
    - decode the following for me
        - Missing rows are:
            - two 1's, one 0, seven 1's, one 0, one 1
            - three 1's, seven 0's, two 1's
- Pixels can be anything
    - What are some examples?
        - Legos

- Now going to make our own art
    - Going to make your own black and white design on this paper
    - Encode it and trade it with someone
    - Share to see if you came up with the right thing
- After the bring everyone back together
- What did we learn?
- What is different between what we did and real pictures?
- Show real pictures in vim mode
    - `:%!xxd -b`

## Bonus lesson

- How do we do colors?
- More 1's and 0's!
- RGB slider in word
- Encode their own colored picture
