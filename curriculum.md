# Curriculum

## Mission Statement

To demystify the computer and give students confidence to look "inside"
abstractions. The theme will be "it's not magic". The aim will be to instil
confidence when approaching new technology.

## Progression

- Day 1: Program each other
    - How is this similar to dealing with computers?
    - How long would this take to do for a robot?
- Day 2: Video Game intro
    - Game loops

    - What is programming
        - Getting computers to do stuff
        - Good programming is minimizing the effort to get computer to do stuff
            - "Folding" to effeciently represent stuff
    - Choose your own adventure story
        - if/else at decisions
        - Make "days" a function
        - Putting that in a loop -> ground hog day

            - 
    - Recursive Art
        - Sketch a tree
        - Draw a tree before and after learn about recursion

        - Halt and catch fire instruction
    - Binary cross word puzzle
        - Put questions at both top and bottom of page to show context matters
    - Emulators are computers running on other computers
    - emojis

    - Memory, CPU, etc
    - "Fix it yourself" movement
- Day 25: Take apart a computer
    - Take pictures while taking apart
    - Lay out all the pieces on a labeled piece of paper
    - Put back together (time?)

- Day 27:
    - Download a picture and talk about each step
- Day 28:
    - Abstraction!
        - Where do you gain power through abstraction?
        - Where do you lose power?
        - Engineers have messed up a lot of stuff by thinking they can solve stuff by only looking at high-level
          abstractions and ignoring the details.
            - What are examples of this?
                - Social Media and censorship
