- IF LONG BLOCK
    - What is an algorithm?
    - Card sorting algorithm
- Today going to start to use scratch
    - Walk through logging in/logging out of scratch
        - Things to hit:
            - Logging in, naming project, saving, sharing
        - Watch me:
            - What do you notice?
