# Curriculum

## Mission Statement

To demystify the computer and give students confidence to look "inside"
abstractions. The theme will be "it's not magic". The aim will be to instil
confidence when approaching new technology.

## Progression

Day 1: Program each other
    - How is this similar to dealing with computers?
    - How long would this take to do for a robot?
Day 2: Video Game intro
    - Game loops
Day 3 - 20: Scratch Video Games and Art
    - What is programming
        - Getting computers to do stuff
        - Good programming is minimizing the effort to get computer to do stuff
            - "Folding" to effeciently represent stuff
    - Recursive Art
        - Sketch a tree
        - Draw a tree before and after learn about recursion
    - Watch Mandelbrot stuff
    - Compare old and new movies
    - Simulations
        - Balls bouncing
            - Conservation of momentum
            - leave behind paint for cool picture effects
    - Choose your own adventure story
        - if/else at decisions
        - Make "days" a function
        - Putting that in a loop -> ground hog day
        - Do a calendary loop
            - 5 "weekdays" then 2 "weekends"
        - Groundhog day (Andy Sandberg's movie)

Day 21:
    - Abstraction discussion
    - How do computers abstract things
    - Where else do we see abstraction
Day 22 - 23: Shell
    - Resources
        - https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/navigation
    - Folders
    - Hacking
    - Hand out pocket protectors
    - netcat -> file sharing
    - sed / find
    - Big chat log, find mean things
    - Why better than a GUI? Why worse?
    - Hidden files (starts with `.`)
    - Find a file
        - Give them a weird directory structure (messy) of family photos
        - Find a particular thing
    - Change ccolors of command line and such
Day 24 - 30: Bits and Binary
    - Numbers, colors, pictures
    - hexedit on shell
    - Tie back to abstraction
    - Show program running in GDB
        - Halt and catch fire instruction
    - Binary cross word puzzle
        - Put questions at both top and bottom of page to show context matters
    - Emulators are computers running on other computers
    - emojis
Day 24: Pieces of a computer
    - Memory, CPU, etc
    - "Fix it yourself" movement
Day 25: Take apart a computer
    - Take pictures while taking apart
    - Lay out all the pieces on a labeled piece of paper
    - Put back together (time?)
    - Bash a hard drive
        - Where is the picture stored?
Day 26: Visit server room
    - ssh into computer
    - Bitcoin
    - Original computers were big, shared things
Day 27:
    - Download a picture and talk about each step
Day 28:
    - Abstraction!
        - Where do you gain power through abstraction?
        - Where do you lose power?
        - Engineers have messed up a lot of stuff by thinking they can solve stuff by only looking at high-level
          abstractions and ignoring the details.
            - What are examples of this?
                - Social Media and censorship
Day 29:
    - Learn to change a tire
    - How do we learn to change a tire?
        - Google it and create an expected list
        - See if what they came up with is right
        - Go out and do it!
