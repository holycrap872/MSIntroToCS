Functions

EQ's:
	What is abstraction?
	Why is abstraction useful?	
	What is a function?
	How to exploit functions effectively.


Lesson Plan:

Day 1
Abstraction Article discussion
Then what?

Day 2
What are functions
	Inputs and outputs
	Contract
Why functions?
	Makes hard stuff easier
	Abstraction
Types of functions
	Command (it's not like command does nothing, it just changes the property of something which is represented in ways other than a return. ie move))
	Reporter (Like everything in math)
	Predicate
Give examples in BYOB
	Give example by double clicking on blocks
	>, touching, key pressed
	go to, play sound, pen down
	distance to, join word, round
Flow of execution
Examples
	A person is baking a cake.		What is the function doing?		What type of function is this?		What is/are the inputs(s)?		What is/are the outputs(s)?		Represent what this block might look like in scratch.
	A magician asks a participant to pick a card, any card
		What is the function doing?		What type of function is this?		What is/are the inputs(s)?		What is/are the outputs(s)?		Represent what this block might look like in scratch.

In BYOB
	Double clicking on blocks shows their value
	Return values use plugins
	T/F for control blocks (Actual blocks in operators screen)
Make a block
	Show how to make a block
	which is greater x y
Real Life Functions worksheet




Part 2
Review Functions
	Everything is scratch is a function


Example situation:
	You go to a bank to withdraw money.
		What is the function doing?		What type of function is this?		What is/are the inputs(s)?		What is/are the outputs(s)?		Represent what this block might look like in scratch.
Together:
	Make a block that makes a star of size
	Make block that says something 3 times
	Make a block that adds 5 to something
	What blocks could we make out of other blocks?
		go to x y
		change by
		distance to
	If can make these, then why does scratch give them to us?

How to use functions
	Break down problems into smaller ones
	RPS
		Break it down

Next Class:

Review functions
Go over Worksheet1
Opening Problem:
	Make block that finds distance to origin
		What information do you need?
	Use so only draws when sprite within 100 of origin
	User Example.ypr as example

Functions to make in BYOB
distance to x, y
change pen by
play intro sound (theme song for sprite)
go to x y

Others:
