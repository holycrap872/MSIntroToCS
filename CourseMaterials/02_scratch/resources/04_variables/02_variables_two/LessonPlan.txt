Lesson Plan

Review
	Variables
		Set, change, read
	Why are variables useful
	Set outside loop, change inside
	Variables that come build in
	Band
Call on someone to make fading sound
	Review what's going on behind scenes with tempo change
Sometimes going to have to use our own variables
	For example, no change note
	How could we deal with this so can hear every note
		Could have a 120 line program but that would be annoying
		make own variable
		What's good name for this variable
			note!
			often times finding a good variable name is the most important part
			helps you know how to use it
		Create it and listen to it
		at end of program "Now every dog in the neighborhood is barking"
		See `EveryNote` example in accompanying scratch program
	Do same thing for listening to every instrument
                See `EveryInstrument` example in accompanying scratch program
Today going to use this ability to make a lot of different types of programs
	These are classic intro course problems
	Create variable "name"
	Set "name" to name of someone in class
	Create program (say (join("hello")(name))) and run it
		This is cool we have now made a program that can say hello to anyone in the world
	Introduce Ask block
		special ask variable
		What user says gets moved into ask variable
	Add onto above program to ask for name to say hello to
		See `GreetPerson` example in accompanying scratch program
	Further examples
		Password program
			See `Password` example in accompanying scratch program
		Count number of times you've said something
		Multiply by 2 program
			Ask for number and say number multiplied by 2
		Program that adds 2 numbers
			Let break and ask what went wrong
			Need holder variables
			introduce concept that variables can only remember 1 thing
