## Essential Questions

- How can we use variables to produce more efficient programs?
- How can we use variables to create useful programs for a human user?

## Lesson Plan

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Variables
        - Set, change, store
    - Why are variables useful?
    - Why set outside loop, change inside
- Call on someone to help make a program that plays all the notes
    - Review what's going on behind scenes with note change
    - Discuss
        - Could have a 120 line program but that would be annoying
        - What's a good name for this variable
        - Create it and listen to it
        - At end of program "Now every dog in the neighborhood is barking"
        - See `EveryNote` example in accompanying scratch program
- Today going to use this ability to make a lot of different types of programs
    - These are classic intro course problems
    - Create variable `name`
    - Set `name`` to name of someone in class
    - Create program (say (join("hello ")(name))) and run it
        - This is cool we have now made a program that can say hello to anyone in the world
    - Introduce `ask and wait` block
        - special `ask`` variable
        - What user says gets moved into `ask`` variable
    - Add onto above program to ask for name to say hello to
        - See `GreetPerson` example in accompanying scratch program
    - Further examples
        - Password program
            - See `Password` example in accompanying scratch program
        - Count number of times you've said something
        - Multiply by 2 program
            - Ask for number and say number multiplied by 2
        - Program that adds 2 numbers
            - Let break and ask what went wrong
            - Need holder variables
            - introduce concept that variables can only remember 1 thing
