## Essential Questions

- How do multiple layers of abstraction affect understandability?
- What does too much abstraction do to a user?

## Lesson Plan

In this lesson, we discuss the difference between magic and technology. The
goal is to see that magic is an as of yet not understood force. This, in turn,
will lead to a discussion about how abstraction can make our interactions with
certain technologies "magic-like" since we don't understand them. Treating
things as magic has an important effect: it allows us to become passive. This
passivity can be good because it makes things easier to understand. The
passivity can be bad, however, because we are at the mercy of the people who
control the "magic", whose purposes have historically not always been the best.

Summed up, the phrase "as if by magic" can be used to both save us time and
to hide important details from us.

### Setup

- Venn diagrams on pieces of paper
- Catesian planes on pieces of paper
- Pencils

### Actual Lesson

- Review
    - Last class we...
- Going to pause programming for a while
    - Going to have a unit about how we use technology
    - Today going to discuss technology and magic
- Repeat twice, once about technology, and once about magic
    - Stand up and find a partner who has the same shoe color
        - "What is technology/magic"
            - Discuss for 1m
            - Switch and discuss with a new partner
    - Come back and discuss
        - Put key words on board under "technology/magic"
- Break into groups of two (last partner) and do a venn diagram of magic vs. tech
    - Have them put the words captured on board in venn diagram
    - Do some examples together
    - They should have 3-4 in each section
- Class wide discussion
- Questions:
    - What are things you interact with today that might be considered magic centuries ago?
    - What are magical things in books that we're already better at?
    - Why would some modern (useful) gadgets be considered magic while others are not?
    - What is abstraction?

#### Day 2

- Review
    - Technology vs. Magic
    - Both are about making things easier
    - Technology is something we can control
- Today going to do another discussion about magic
    - Compare what seems like magic to modern people and ancient people
    - Draw grid on board
        - Explain
        - Pick a few random points and ask what means then ask for examples
- Break up into small groups start giving them objects
    - Ask them to label
    - Two dimensions: magic then, magic now
        - Possible objects:
            - Fire
            - Bicycles
            - Television
            - Steam Engine
            - Eyeglasses
            - Compass
            - Radio
            - Telegraph
            - Microwave
            - Solar Panels
            - IC car
            - Electic car
            - Cameras
            - Painting
            - Robot
            - Chat CPT
            - Textile production
            - Fermentation
    - Break for 10m for discussion
    - Have them come up with their own objects in each quadrant
- Come back and discuss
    - Note whenever people have the same object in different spots
    - Come up with definition for magic
- Pivot to abstraction
    - Who knows what abstraction is?
    - Why is abstraction useful?
        - "As if by magic, something works"
    - When can abstraction be dangerous?
