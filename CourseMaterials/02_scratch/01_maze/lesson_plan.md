Scratch Intro

## EQ's:

- How can we combine our understanding of conditionals and the game loop
  to formally solve a problem with a computer that we did previously with humans?
- 

## Lesson Plan

### Setup

- Have maze.sb3 loaded up with code hidden

### Actual Lesson

> NOTE: Have them minimize scratch whenever working as a group

- Reflection:
    - What did we talk about last lesson?
    - What is a loop?
    - How does the game loop work?
    - What is a conditional?
    - What is an example of a conditional in a game?
    - What is an example of a conditional in your life?
- Scratch initialization
    - Show how to log in
    - Walk through various parts (see if they remember from previous courses)
        - blocks
        - different tabs
        - run (Green flag)
        - multiple sprites
        - costumes
    - Sprites
        - Show where to find properties
    - Cartesian Plane
        - Draw on board and explain
    - How going to program
        - Only do 1 green flag
        - No when space bar pressed
        - No glides
        - Why doing it this way
            - Trying to program as realistically as possible.
    - Basic Exercises
        - Cartesian cat (Loop between 2 different places) (Together)
        - Box step
        - Move, wait, move, wait, move, wait (Together)
        - Move Cat (Together)
            - Cat starts on left and moves to right side of screen when green flag clicked
            - Make analogy to movie, small movements stuck together make it look good
        - Only moves when spacebar pressed
        - Drive Cat (together)
            - Arrow keys control direction of cat
            - Space bar makes it move forward
    - Pause and go over common problems and ask why bad
        - Nested ifs
        - No forever loop
        - Inits inside of foreverloop
    - Maze game
        - Show game that I made
            - Show how to make own background
            - Show if touching color block command
        - Come up with steps to work on together:
            - Draw map
            - Get initialization working
            - Movement
            - Collsions
            - NPCs?
        - Go!
- Extensions:
    - Make look like cat's running when moving
    - "q" quits the game
    - Multiple Levels
    - Timer
    - Lives
