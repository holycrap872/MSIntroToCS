## Essential Questions

- What shapes can we create using recursion?
- When and why is a base-case important?

## Lesson Plan

- Review
    - Fractal
    - Have them make a Sierpinski fractal
        - Why is this a fractal?
- Talk about recursion
    - Definition for running a marathon
    - One foot in front of other (if done race stop)
    - Where have we seen recursion before
        - Robozzle/Lightbot
- Draw a series of circles together
    - `def circle(size) -> repeat 90(turn 4, move size)`
- Do recursion worksheet
    - Stairs (from robozzle)
    - Alter given tree code
    - Alter sierpinski triangle code
    - Create own fractal
- What does it take to make a good fractal
    - Find the pattern
    - That's all it takes for programming!
