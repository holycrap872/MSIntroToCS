Throughout the term, we looked into various topics in the world of Computer
Science and tried to understand some of the big ideas within the field. Along
the way, we worked hard to demystify how computers work and focused on going
into new types of problems with confidence and a "can do" attitude.

In particular, we designed video games, took apart computers, and learned how
the terminal isn't just for hackers. We also worked to understand how simple 1's
and 0's can be used to represent different forms of data such as numbers,
letters, and pictures. Finally, we worked to connect the ideas to more
accessible forms by looking for patterns in everyday life.
